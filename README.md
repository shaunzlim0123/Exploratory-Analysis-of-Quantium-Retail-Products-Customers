## Analysis Framework

This comprehensive analysis was structured around four key analytical approaches to understand customer purchasing behavior in the chips category. The exploratory data analysis phase examined temporal patterns in transaction volumes over time, revealing seasonal trends and identifying key purchasing periods. 

![Transactions in December 2018](figures/figure1.png)

The temporal analysis clearly demonstrates the seasonal purchasing patterns, with transaction volumes steadily increasing throughout December 2018, reaching peak levels just before Christmas, followed by a complete drop to zero transactions on Christmas Day itself due to store closures. This pattern validates the importance of seasonal planning and inventory management strategies.

Product distribution analysis focused on understanding pack size preferences and brand popularity across the customer base, while customer behavior analysis investigated purchase quantities and shopping frequencies to identify distinct behavioral patterns.

![Distribution of Pack Sizes](figures/figure2.png)

The pack size distribution reveals that the majority of transactions involve medium-sized packages around 170g, with significantly fewer transactions for both smaller and larger pack sizes. This distribution pattern provides crucial insights for product portfolio optimization and shelf space allocation decisions.

The customer segment analysis formed the core of the investigation, examining four critical metrics across all customer segments. Total sales analysis revealed which segments generate the most revenue for the business, while customer count analysis determined the relative size of each segment. Average units per customer provided insights into purchase intensity and shopping behavior, and average price per unit served as an indicator of price sensitivity across different customer groups. This multi-faceted approach enabled a comprehensive understanding of how different customer segments contribute to overall business performance.

Statistical testing was employed to validate observed differences between customer segments, specifically comparing mainstream customers against budget and premium segments regarding their price sensitivity. The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference with a p-value less than 0.05 and a t-statistic of 37.83, confirming that mainstream customers exhibit distinct pricing behavior compared to other segments.

The deep dive analysis focused specifically on the Mainstream Young Singles/Couples segment, which emerged as a key target group. This detailed examination included brand affinity analysis to understand preference patterns, pack size preference analysis to identify optimal product offerings, and the development of commercial insights that translate analytical findings into actionable business recommendations.

## Key Findings

### Data Quality and Outlier Management

The initial data exploration revealed that while the dataset contained no null values, there was a significant outlier in product quantity where 200 packets of chips were purchased in single transactions. Investigation revealed that these unusual transactions were made by the same customer (loyalty card number 226000) on two separate occasions, both involving Dorito Corn Chip Supreme 380g packages. Further analysis showed this customer had no other transaction history, suggesting commercial rather than retail purchasing behavior. This customer was subsequently removed from the analysis to ensure accurate representation of typical retail customer behavior.

### Temporal and Seasonal Patterns

The analysis revealed distinct seasonal purchasing patterns, with sales increasing significantly in the lead-up to Christmas, followed by zero sales on Christmas Day itself due to store closures. This pattern indicates the importance of seasonal planning and inventory management for the chips category, particularly during peak holiday periods when demand surges.

### Customer Segment Performance

![Total Sales by Life Stage and Premium Customer Segment](figures/figure3.png)

The customer segment analysis revealed that revenue generation is concentrated among specific demographic groups. The heatmap clearly shows that Older Families in the Budget segment (dark red, $156,864) and Young Singles/Couples in the Mainstream segment (dark red, $147,582) represent the highest revenue-generating segments. Mainstream Retirees also contribute significantly with $145,169 in total sales, making them the top three revenue-generating segments.

![Number of Customers by Life Stage and Premium Customer Segment](figures/figure4.png)

The analysis of customer counts revealed that Mainstream Young Singles/Couples (7,917 customers) and Mainstream Retirees (6,358 customers) represent the largest customer bases purchasing chips. For the Budget Older Families segment, however, higher sales appear to be driven more by purchase intensity rather than customer volume, suggesting different underlying purchasing motivations across segments.

![Average Units per Customer by Life Stage and Premium Customer Segment](figures/figure5.png)

Purchase intensity analysis showed that Older Families and Young Families generally purchase more chips per customer, with Older Families achieving the highest average of 9.3 units per customer across all premium segments. This behavior pattern suggests that family-oriented segments use chips for household consumption and entertaining, leading to higher volume purchases.

### Price Sensitivity and Purchasing Behavior

![Average Price per Unit by Life Stage and Premium Customer Segment](figures/figure6.png)

Price sensitivity analysis revealed significant behavioral differences across customer segments. The heatmap shows that Mainstream Young Singles/Couples demonstrate the highest willingness to pay premium prices at $4.07 per unit (darkest purple), which represents a statistically significant difference compared to budget and premium customer segments. Mainstream Midage Singles/Couples also show elevated price tolerance at $3.99 per unit. This premium pricing acceptance suggests impulse buying behavior among mainstream customers, particularly younger demographics who may prioritize convenience and brand preferences over price optimization.

The analysis indicated that mainstream midage and young singles and couples are consistently more willing to pay higher prices per packet compared to their budget and premium counterparts. This counterintuitive finding regarding premium customers may reflect their tendency to purchase healthier snack alternatives, with chip purchases primarily for entertainment purposes rather than regular consumption.

### Brand Affinity and Product Preferences

![Brand Affinity and Pack Size Affinity: Mainstream Young Singles/Couples](figures/figure7.png)

The deep dive into Mainstream Young Singles/Couples revealed distinct brand and pack size preferences that significantly exceed population averages. The brand affinity analysis shows Tyrrells leading with the highest affinity index (1.21), followed closely by Twisties (1.20), Doritos (1.19), and Kettle (1.18). These preferences indicate strong brand loyalty within this segment and present opportunities for targeted marketing and merchandising strategies.

Pack size analysis revealed that this target segment shows strong preferences for larger pack sizes, with 270g packages showing the highest affinity index (1.25), followed by 380g packages (1.23) and 330g packages (1.20). Interestingly, the 270g preference appears to be entirely driven by Twisties brand, which is the only manufacturer offering this specific pack size, suggesting that pack size preferences may be influenced by brand availability and positioning.

### Commercial Implications

The analysis findings suggest that Mainstream Young Singles/Couples represent a high-value target segment due to their combination of large customer base, willingness to pay premium prices, and strong brand preferences. Their 23% higher likelihood to purchase Tyrrells chips compared to the general population, combined with their preference for larger pack sizes, indicates significant opportunities for category growth through strategic product placement and merchandising.

The recommendation centers on leveraging these insights through off-location placement of Tyrrells and smaller pack sizes in discretionary spaces frequented by young singles and couples. This strategy aims to capitalize on their demonstrated impulse buying behavior while increasing product visibility in relevant shopping environments. The statistical significance of their different purchasing behavior provides confidence that targeted interventions will yield measurable results, setting the foundation for trial measurement and impact assessment in subsequent analytical phases.
